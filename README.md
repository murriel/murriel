Murriel's Personal Website
=========================

## Description
Still a work in progress. this was a bit of a learning project for me. While I've done bits of coding here and there, most of my life has been in the system administration and operations world.

I had been very casually dabbling in various other languages through <insert name of random learn to code site or MOOC here> as it seemed like a good idea to beef up my coding skills. While wandering in the quagmire of coding languages, frameworks and backends, I dropped into Ruby's gravitational field and found myself hooked.

I found GitHub pages to be a very convenient place for hosting, and then I learned about Jekyll and grew very interested in the idea of static site generators.

From a non-technical perspective, there are several other reasons that I was attracted to Ruby (and further, Rails):
- Community
- RailsGirls
- Cool logo
- Jekyll has been fun and for the most part, rather friendly

From a technical perspective:
- Ruby knowledge will be applicable to Puppet/Chef
- Rails while heavy is quick and easy to get running, good for prototyping

I don't have enough of the foundations and fundamentals of down to speak to any of the other technical reasons that ruby may excel over <some other programming language> but hope to discover this somewhere through this journey.
